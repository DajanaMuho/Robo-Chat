# Question & Answer Chatbot

### Goals

The ROBO-CHAT should be able to:

      ● Take in a user input and determine whether it is small-talk or a question.

      ● Respond appropriately to small talk questions.

      ● Return an accurate answer to a question posed by the user.

      ● End the chat when the user specifies a command indicating a desire to end the
      conversation.
